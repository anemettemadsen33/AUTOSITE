- Use Snyk or SonarQube for additional scanning
- Schedule penetration testing
- Document all findings and remediation
- Get sign-off from security team

### 2. Implement Comprehensive Tests (CRITICAL - 1-2 weeks)
**Why**: Only 2 example tests exist
**What to do**:
- Implement unit tests (templates in TESTING.md)
- Implement integration tests
- Implement E2E tests for critical flows
- Target: 70%+ code coverage
- All tests must pass

### 3. Performance Validation (HIGH - 2-3 days)
**Why**: Production performance must be validated
**What to do**:
- Run Lighthouse tests (target: 90+)
- Load test API endpoints
- Profile database queries
- Optimize slow queries
- Test under production-like load

### 4. Infrastructure Setup (HIGH - 1-2 days)
**Why**: Production infrastructure must be ready
**What to do**:
- Set up production servers
- Configure monitoring (Sentry, New Relic)
- Configure automated backups
- Test backup restoration
- Set up alerting
